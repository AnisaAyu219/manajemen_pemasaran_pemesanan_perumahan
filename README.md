## 📌 Housing Marketing and Booking Management Application

## 🚫 Source Code Not Included
This application is owned by the company and is part of the internal system of PT Sobo Asri. Therefore, I am unable to share the source code publicly due to the company’s confidentiality policy.

### 🚧 Problem Statement
In Sobo Asri Housing, the marketing process relies solely on printed brochures, which limits access to detailed information about available housing units.

Additionally, prospective buyers must contact the housing staff directly to inquire about unit availability, as there is no real-time update system.

The home buying process is still manual and lacks transparency, requiring buyers to reach out to the housing office to check the status of their purchase.

### 💡 Proposed Solution
To address the problems identified, I developed a housing information application that allows potential buyers to easily access all necessary information in real-time and independently.

**This application includes the following key features:**

- **🏡 Housing Unit Catalog**
Displays detailed information about each unit, including type, specifications, images, and pricing, for all available houses in Sobo Asri Residential Area.

- **🗺️ Interactive Site Map**
The application features a kavling map that shows the exact location of each unit, allowing potential buyers to visualize unit positions and their proximity to nearby facilities.

- **✅ Real-Time Unit Availability**
Users can instantly check which units are available without needing to contact the housing office.

- **🛒 Online Purchase Requests**
Buyers can initiate the purchase process directly through the application, making it more efficient and well-documented.

- **📊 Purchase Status Tracking**
Buyers can monitor the status of their purchase transparently—from submission to approval—without having to make repeated inquiries.

By using this application, the sales and purchase processes become more efficient, transparent, and modern, improving both user experience and the professional image of the housing management.
